# Changelog

## 0.4.1 (2026-11-11)

- Repository moved to `TryApraxo/doc-chaser`; links and install commands updated.

## 0.4.0 (2026-11-11)

- The plugin no longer ships any scripts. The directory will accept scripts only from Verified organizations, so the five skills that used one now carry the formula, counting procedure or rules in their instructions and reference files, with check cases.
- `calculating-trid-deadlines`: the reference file gains the counting procedure, a holiday table for 2026 to 2028 and six check cases.
- Removed the script unit tests; the eval suite remains.

## 0.3.2 (2026-11-11)

- Repository moved to `ApraxoTeam/doc-chaser`; links and install commands updated.

## 0.3.1 (2026-11-11)

- Removed two manifest fields (`supportUrl`, `documentationUrl`) that the directory does not recognize. The support and documentation links remain in the README.

## 0.3.0 (2026-11-11)

- Renamed the plugin from its working name to `doc-chaser` before first listing. No skill changed.

- New skill `drafting-gift-letters`: mortgage gift letter with the elements in Fannie Mae Selling Guide B3-4.3-04, eligibility checks and the transfer evidence to collect.
- New skill `assessing-safeguards-readiness`: FTC Safeguards Rule self-assessment with a gap report and the 16 CFR 314.6 small-firm exemption.
